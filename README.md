  - [topojson](https://github.com/topojson/topojson): an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology that was used to
    help create a map projection for the fourth visualization.
  - [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic): used to create color schemes that work with 
    d3-scaleâ€™s d3.scaleOrdinal and d3.scaleSequential
